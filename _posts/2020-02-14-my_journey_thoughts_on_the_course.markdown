This blog post is the very last thing I need to do before I will "graduate" from the Flatiron School Online Data Science Part-Time Course.  I started this journey back on March 11, 2019, almost 11 months ago to the day.  Though I haven't landed a Data Science job, or even started looking yet, I feel confident that I made a good decision by deciding to enroll here all those months ago.

### Path to Bootcamp

I decided to enter this course because I had been in an entirely different profession for the last 6 years.  I have been a self-employed Rare Coin and Medals dealer.  I buy things from many different venues (online & in-person) and I sell them, almost exclusively online, for more than I bought them for (on average).  It has been an awesome experience and I've been more successful than I would have ever thought possible.  But it's not the type of job I ever wanted to do for a lifetime.  I knew I would eventually need something more stable, regular, and with more potential for growth.

But unless I stayed in roughly the same type of field I was already in as a coin dealer (work in a major auction house, or maybe even a museum), I knew the time away from whatever profession I would be pursuing would hurt my ability to land a decent job.  So I knew I would likely need more education to kick-start my abilities in a different field and also make me more employable.  Since I already have a bachelor's degree, I did not want to go back to a university to obtain another 4-year degree.  But I also was hesitant to pursue another job directly in the field of my degree, computer science.

College was a difficult time for me both mentally and emotionally.  I had serious struggles with depression and anxiety that seemed to come out of nowhere and I was not able to get in control of these things until many years later.  I was able to make it through and graduate but my experiences (both learning and otherwise) were seriously tainted.  I did not learn as much as I would have if I was healthy, and I did not perform in my courses as well as I would have if I was healthy.  I believe these things in combination with just the general personal struggles, are why I never got the programming/software engineering job I was seeking post-graduation.  It probably also didn't help that the job market in 2011 was not ideal.  I ended up taking a Technical Support Analyst role for a big medical software company called Cerner in Kansas City, MO, half-way across the country.  The job was actually pretty decent and I could have seen growth even into a good engineering/programming position, but it was a horrible fit for me.  At this point, I still had not begun to receive treatment for my anxiety issues, so having to communicate on the phone every day with doctors/nurses/support staff, often in high-stress scenarios was the last thing I should have been doing.  So I had to quit about 10 months after taking the job and I moved back home with my parents. Thankfully, all was not lost, my time alone in KC was the beginning of my understanding of the problems I was dealing with and I finally began to receive treatment for my mental issues starting a couple of years after that.

### Flatiron Experience

So basically, that just all explains why I was hesitant to try again to get into the programming/software engineering world, even though now with treatment I am in a much better place mentally and emotionally.  I had really never heard of a boot camp up until that point but they seemed very popular and there was a ton of information out there on them.  At first, I was going to go with a programming boot camp to get somewhat of a fresh start in the field but then a light bulb sort of went off in my head when I saw a few of these companies that were putting on the coding boot camps were also putting on data science boot camps.  It was a chance to truly get a fresh start in a similar but different field than computer science.  But it also just seemed to be a better fit for me.  

I looked at Data Science (right or wrong) as a combination of programming, math, statistics, and business.  
- I liked programming in school but didn't love it, so I would be happy to do it sometimes but not be the bulk of what I was doing.  
- I enjoyed my upper-level Math courses more than I did most of my Computer Science courses (if I was to do college over again I would get a Math degree).  
- I don't have much statistics experience but I've naturally always been a numbers/data/analyzation guy.  
- I learned from my time as a Coin dealer I have a pretty good natural business sense


So after reading about Data Science and considering these things about my own interests, I was sold that I was going to try to get into a Data Science program.  

Flatiron was the first place I applied to because they had great reviews, offered a money-back policy, and had a physical location in DC.  Thankfully, I was accepted into the program after the 2 interviews.

Overall, the experience was great.  

I am very happy with the instructor I was assigned.  Victor is very sharp and was good at communicating the learning material.  But he also was very supportive, flexible, and has a calm demeanor.

Any time I had to communicate with other Flatiron support staff they were very responsive, helpful, and kind.

The other people that started in the cohort with me were all nice and seemed smart.  But I am more of a solo worker so I wasn't too interested in making outside connections with anyone.  Which ended up for the better, because the number of people in the cohort sharply dwindled over time.  In the beginning, I believe, there were about 10 people in our group.  At the end, there are now just 2 people besides me still left, and those 2 people were not original members of the cohort but rather transferred in a few months later.

From what I saw just from my experience, I would caution potential applicants of this program who don't have at least some level of programming experience.  The learning material and pace are challenging, and I could see how I might have had trouble keeping up if I didn't already have decent programming experience from my CS degree. 

I think the curriculum was well put together and had a fresh, engaging style.  There were a lot of grammatical mistakes but since it didn't prevent my understanding, that kind of thing doesn't bother me too much.  It stays at a good and pretty even pace the whole way through.  There were a couple of times I felt on the verge of being burned out from too much difficult material, but I managed to stay afloat.  The breaks for holidays were very helpful in this regard.

Ultimately, I have learned a lot
- lots of Python experience
- lots of Pandas experience
- good amount of Sklearn experience
- I'm better with git and github than when I was a CS student
- combining writing and code in Jupyter Notebooks to tell the data story you want

Requiring presentations for each project was helpful as someone who is not a natural speaker/presenter.  And the short-time limit allowed per presentation challenged me to become better at summarizing the most important things.  I'm also glad they emphasized making visualizations for each project/presentation because that is something I needed practice doing. 

### Moving Forward

I did not feel comfortable in my ability to find a job in data science transitioning directly from being a coin dealer for the past 6 years.  But I feel pretty comfortable that I now will be successful in finding a job after having completed this course.  Besides the skills I have picked up, I hope employers will realize that completing this course in itself is an achievement.
